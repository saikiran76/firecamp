## 💭 Philosophy
The decentralization of tools, processes, and people creates friction in API development workflow and frustration across the team. Developers are constantly switching between tools, searching for information, and wasting time due to inefficient tools.
We believe that the existing solution lacks both world-class experience and the simplicity needed to build APIs faster. This leads to a decrease in developer productivity, slow release times, and poor team collaboration.
We are bringing the VS code philosophy to Firecamp to solve this critical problem. Our mission is to build the most extensible, minimal, and best developer experience API platform where developers feel most productive while building APIs.

## 🏄  What's cool about this?

Firecamp is a Multi-protocol API platform, which offers end-to-end testing and development of Rest, GraphQL, WebSocket, and many other APIs.
We support major API specifications and protocols, which allows for seamless API testing, API documentation, and smoother collaboration between backend, frontend, and mobile teams.
